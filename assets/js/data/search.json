However, the transition to structured university courses was a profound shift. The change in pace proved to be a significant challenge. The course material, while necessary, didn’t always ignite my passion. Some days felt like I was merely treading water, far from the developer I aspired to be. It’s safe to say there were more days of doubt than days of confidence.The College Conundrum:I’ve often wondered whether attending university was the right choice for me. These doubts have been compounded by stories of self-taught developers finding success. However, one undeniable truth is that, in today’s job market, a bachelor’s degree is often the minimum requirement for “higher-level” positions.Navigating Group Work:Group work constituted a significant part of my first year of the Software Engineering program, but it wasn’t always a smooth journey. I approached these projects with the aim of creating good software and learning, but my teammates often seemed more focused on passing the class. The realization that most of them had never written code outside of assignments was both surprising and disheartening.Not only programming countsI have learned a very important lession though. Something that I will take with me going forward. However good I am at programming, it will amount to nothing if I cant communicate with other team members. What my focus will be this school year is getting better at communicating. That means all the stuff I think is boring such as documenting, talking in a friendly manner and accepting that other people can see things I cannot, my way is not always the only way." }, { "title": "A Website for a hairsalon", "url": "/posts/fris%C3%B6r-cleopatra/", "categories": "HTML/CSS/JS, TE4, client", "tags": "", "date": "2021-09-24 02:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "Frisör Cleopatra is a website that me and two others are developing for a (fake) client.

It has a backend written in C++ and a frontend using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We have divided the work into frontend and backend. Im doing the backend part. The vision is that it’s a forum that is focused on privacy. There is no register- or login-system, instead its using cookies to identify a user. We don’t save any information about the user other than a random string we call Unique User Identifier (UUID) and a random int User Identifier (UID). The cookie we send to the user is the UUID and is the translated into the UID, the UID is then viewed almost as a username on the website. To write the backend I am using a framework called Drogon.Links Github Repository DrogonContributors Christoffer Ljung Ahlstedt" } ]
